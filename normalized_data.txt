we're my husband as i are curious about that
she kinda picked up her letters quite spontaneously and i
but she came home from her play group counting one day
and i thought it was primarily because_of repetition she picked up
but my husband and i are wondering if she doesn't
now today she didn't demonstrate that very well
but we saw her playing by herself one night after he'd come
we were talking in the kitchen and she just naturally sort of
and she had some wooden spools and she had them in a semicircle
so my husband and i sort a observed her from the doorway and
and he also wondered the same thing
we hadn't discussed it together
and he went out and he asked her how many there were and she
he removed one and he asked her how many there were and she
five
whereupon we decided that really there was something
so we've you know we've encouraged her to count but i
you know other than being exposed to this book which is
i mean i hadn't sat down and taught her one two three
and neither had he and neither had my daughter
and i've quizzed the babysitter and she hadn't either so
or if if she's so fascinated she lies and counts by
with pleasure
i mean it gives her great pleasure to to count and if
or give her an environment that will promote it
i see
well today obviously i was trying to get her to to to
and she substituted that at one point i think
the counting for the colors
i asked her how many no i asked her what color the crayons were
mother get off my back
yes she does
yes she does amazing things with the flat wooden blocks
she plays with occasionally but her babysitter
and they are incredibly wonderful
and she every night creates something with them
and they are very interesting blocks
they they they go perpendicular or this way
she does not have a toy telephone and as a result she
and she does talk to her daddy regularly
and occasionally her friends
my husband would not let me buy her one
because she had a doll on her one crib machine and he felt
and i acquiesced
i know it was still i think it's the principle of the thing
and everybody has them so really she doesn't
if we're working together i sometimes volunteer it for
yes
she does have a play corner
and she doesn't run loose she's very categorical about her toys
no
she has a small table with a free standing chair
oh no that's in the kitchen actually
she does some work there
she has a standing up table in the play area
and we cleaned it up and it's it's beau she has
with her little little people
she wanted to be there
oh yes she's she capable of climbing in and out_of well
and we hadta dismantle it and put her in a youth bed
she has not been containable once she wants to get out_of something
or into it
she's she'll climb into her playpen if it's set up for
and she's very capable of climbing
she knows all the animal sounds
i found it rather boring to go you know ask her to emote
yes because we've been to the zoological museum at
oh yes
and in pictures she can identify from dress which is the boy
she goes to a playgroup with primarily girls except one
he's a little boy
to it connotes that he's always crying but her friends
but we've been talking about big boys and big girls little
i don't think she has the concept
she has names for all her dolls but we've named them as they
all all her dolls and many of her animals i don't know
but she does understand names of people she knows she knows
both of those things i'm sorry the name i've been trying to
my name is gail
when she's asked and to ask another little friend of hers if
what is your name
my name's gail
and we've done this in the car as a kind of exercise as_well_as
how old are you
and i don't think she has gotten the
how old are you
bit into her head at all
yes
lexington
i think
she knows that we live in lexington but i don't think she really
well she can recite if you ask her she knows all of peter
she knows all of make way for ducklings she knows all of this
well the zipper she knows how to zipper herself
well that zipper's well she doesn't get it started and
it's frustrating and the button is to her i think she's
i don't think she's ever buttoned and the shoelaces
we fool around with laces but i haven't taught her how to tie
she's she's interested in watching me tie her shoes
oh yes
unties everyone's shoes
she's been very interested in she turned last week to her
she has hands
little fingers on them
and it looked so cute
i remembered it and today she mentioned that he had hands
does he have
what else she mentioned the digits there so
yes because we have a rabbit at home that she a puppet
she enjoys him both ways she likes him inanimate and she
www
i noticed that when i was going through some of the play
we've been doing that with her dolls to with her
she really thinks it's her thing
it is
but my husband comes home and his voice goes way up
and she'll come and she's very serious about it and she
but she really believes it but then every now and then
she's been starved for three days ever since her attack of
and yesterday was just a nightmare for her
she kept going to the refrigerator and saying
well how about some pickles
or
how about a donut
and it was just killing
it was so difficult
and today was the first time she's had bananas and wheat
and she's just so delighted that she had crackers and chicken
and she's just she's loved again
so she's got she's got things that she wants to eat on her
she'd love to eat some cheese
she's not gonna have it for a few more days
she knows what meat is
but apparently toast probably appeals to her right now a
she really would like it
so she's probably
yes
she does
we've been also looking in pet stores at the fish
she really knows what it is
i think she knows them
i i think she's i'm encouraging her to
she decided it's time to go home
yes but the reason that i called you now is because we're going
mm pretty about fifty fifty books with everything else
all of her toys as compared to books she'll play with half the
no
no
she prefers i think just the structure of hard books rather
you have cookies down here honey
look at all these
i don't think so i don't think
she doesn't
and i don't know and she did that last time too and to my
hm
she likes to smell flowers
yes
in her head
yes
she plays with our rings and watches and jewelry a lot so
she hugs things a lot and i don't know where she got that
them and oh
i guess we must have done it
we do so many things unconsciously that we don't find out until
she has a monkey that's a puppet
that's why she was calling that a monkey
because that's the only that's right that's the only
so she thought that was all puppets are monkey's i guess
yeah we have a book with those in so she knows i guess
that's about the the limit
she knows birdies
hm
and she says it
usually if she's in the right mood she'll repeat whatever
not really
just whenever i have time
i found that when i want her to learn a word i say
can you say something
but after she's started saying calling something by a word
then she'll say again
no we have a cat
no but she knows about other people's houses
she knows where her friends live we walk down the street
and she knows her own house she knows her grandmother's
she plays a lot with my hair brush
she has a new little toy that she plays with all my hair things
go get the hairbrush
because she'd carried it away from me or
what is this
and she said something that sounded like hairbrush
so i know she knows the word and i think she said it
she can she does
she brushes her own hair in one direction or another not
she likes her blocks
but they're a little smaller and more more interesting i
there's lots_of them in there
easier to build higher things with
put one on top of the other on top of the other on top of the
yes she has she i don't know why but i allowed her
and she has one book that is like this book
i think it's made by the same people
and it has doors that you open
and it has animals
and then they go to bed
and you open the door and see them sleeping
and she loves that with each little door
yes and she has been for a long time
that's one of the ways that we keep her busy
little things in things
she does
yes
to kay kay
do you know where your eyes are
she knows her eyes and her ears
she'll point towards we worry about her eyes says
eyes
and she knows ears and mouth and nose and toes nose is her
nose
no
i don't think she knows either
she said man yesterday but that's the first sex difference
i think yeah i don't think there is much difference for
and her favorite thing is raisin bran and she just as you can see
yeah
no she just likes to drink
she'll just drink water and just drink it
she likes glasses and cups
juice is anything liquid
she calls everything juice water grape juice and milk are
anything liquid is juice
no she has her own but it's a regular bowl
i don't think she would ever say something i think if she
and i don't think she knows a shoe in a book as she does a shoe on
i don't i don't know where she we don't have it so
and she seemed to know right away to turn to the page with
and she knew she patted the bunny which surprised me
it's possible just because everybody has it that she's seen it
she does
she has a set of about fifty little blocks and while i
herself
and that so that's something new that she xxx
they're not
she has gotten this thing about shoes in the last few weeks and
and started taking them off
how do ya like that
hm
she has been around no less than six or eight people a day for
there wasn't too much in there that looked familiar to me
from her experience
well i think the milk she was saying milk at lunch today
put these way in the box
well she knows keys but i don't know if she knows the word
and i think a_lot_of those things apple that she would eat an
well she does call it she does say apple
but i think it's generally for applesauce
she i think she does because when i say egg she comes
she loves eggs
and but i
it sounded like it
but lately she has repeated almost every word we say so you
oh she kisses a lot
she kisses things more than people
she'll kiss dogs and and toys and things she's not big at
no watch kay
she likes watches
scott is well her nephew who she has just been in love with for
and she says scott about every other word out_of her mouth has
we haven't had our telephone with us while we've been away so
so i haven't played with a telephone with her for over two
yeah but this as i said before this one is different from
anyhow so i think she was just
a dial
no
i don't think she would know what a cage is
maybe a cat's cage we have a cage for our cat
but i don't know if she's really seen it
well she has a puppet that we've been surprised that she
she doesn't know how to work it but she likes to put her hand in
and kind of wave it around
don't think so
she knows a_lot_of them but i don't think she knows doesn't
i know she knows i know she knows nose and mouth and
yeah that's one of her best toys
everyone's
her own and other people's
oh she brushes our cat much to his dismay
very well i think
i am surprised that she brushes her own hair pretty well
no
i think that when some people play with blocks with her they say
so she would say the word house but i don't think she knew what
just meant i'm gonna do blocks
she knows what flowers are
we have been going all summer to kind of a wild place in maine
and my mother picked her one flower one day and since then she
and she never goes outside without handfuls of flowers
she smells them other people smell them
in fact she wanted to pick the flowers in the nice little
i ask her that about five times a day
and she doesn't have an answer
i think she does
i think she's just playing with me she won't say it
she knows my name's mommy and daddy's name is dada
not really because
ya wanna get out_of the chair monica
she never she actually insists that she talk
pretty consistent with what she does with the real phone
she'll just say
hi hi
no i think she liked the ringing there are some
hi hi hi
but there's no ringing associated with it and that was more
but at home she can't make that phone ring at her will
this is very important to leave this on mummie
i'm gonna talk to nan for a couple of more minutes
okay
she wants to nurse i think i can probably talk while she nurses
do ya wanna nurse
huh
you hafta leave that on
don't touch that though
don't touch
it's not touching this
it's just that it might be picking up her sucking
i don't know if it would or not
take it off
i think that she is
take it oh that word that phrase she says
take it off
or she she doesn't usually say
put it in
but
take it out
take it out
i can't think of anything offhand right now
but like her sweater something she'll wanna take it off
all of a sudden she'll get an idea that she wants to take it off
put it on put it on
but she has a little hard time putting it on herself
so i'm starting to help her do that
shoes clothing
in general
yeah she does but i can't think like just her toys
actually i'm probably not very good i don't know what
i guess she's been going full time for four weeks
at school
and i have only been here with her this week
or two days
so i actually don't have that much idea in terms of what she
she they do have a_lot_of educational toys there that she's
little holes
and that she's spends an hour trying to do that
and she's able to do it so that she is fascinated
don't touch
just don't touch that
okay you're going to hafta stop nursing if you touch it
i think she does
maybe in more of a negative sense than i'd wanna
sometimes it's my own fault because sometimes at home she will
and in the kitchen and i'll be tripping over her and say
marie go play with your toys
xxx in your room
noq she'll say
no
and i think she does knows what are toys an what
that's not a toy
we're not gonna play with that right now
although i'm not consistent because i do let her play with
such as makeup
parts that it goes on i don't know if it's helped her i
i think she's aware of all parts of her face in fact
and and she has words she says
for her face
cheeks ears eyes brows tongue
gums
tongue the tongue right
pick out one characteristic
yeah
tongue
tongue
yeah there's that tongue in there huh
let's see yes
my husband's been feeding her in the morning oatmeal
a cereal with some sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and raisins in
i don't know
i don't think so
she may have
but they don't look that much like houses to me
i think that's why i chose to tell her
that it was to just although of course she could have
okay let's go marie
many more than before
was it six weeks ago that we were here
so like she's second
clothing
diapers
she knows you know everything that she suits bathing
suit suit
ya wanna bottle okay
bau tou
and then let's see hat she knows it hasn't
oh yeah
a dress
she hardly ever wears a dress though
a couple of times she has she knows dress
no
jeans is a word that she well she has used jeans
no not usually
i just i have hard time getting her to sit you know to
yeah she can
i think i think she knows that though that the same word
things she usually calls she usually calls those
but when i say sneaksq she she says
sneaks
she looked
just like yours yeah
a box
i did that again i did that last time
no she still hasn't been to a zoo to see cages
she has been to a zoo
and she has seen cages once
she has but she was sort of frightened more than
and she associated these bars with her crib because she said he
so i didn't feel like i wanted to confuse it any more
so i think that's probably why i didn't push it with the
yeah she does
she does
an she knows she said that before that whole a segment
i don't know if other kids do this but and you just hafta
yeah we do when we have the time we try i think sometimes
yup
she will
this is a little different though but she did put was
this time
i know exactly why that is
it's because she bugs me at home when i'm in the kitchen and
that dragon doesn't come out honey
her toys are in her room or the living room and they're not
and if i'm doing something in the kitchen and i wanna have some
go and play with your toys
in your room' and she'll say toysq and depending on how she
no
but she is fascinated with the chairs
she climbs up and down onto the kitchen chairs and highchairs all
something
eating sitting in the chairs to eat
yeah that's right
yeah she has that book at home
you know it's it's funny
i thought that she definitely knew that paul was paul or
because for a long time she's been calling them by their
and doing it quite consistently
except today she confused them so
that one was a boy and one was a girl
well i think that because she's still she still calls
so in the beginning all children were boys
and now they're either boys or girls depending on i don't
i've got something for her to eat
now i think she is calling when she sees a girl sometimes she
it's hard i don't think she really distinguishes them
a comb
no i use a comb though
and so she knows that i do and the brush although i use a
yup
no uhuh
but she knows what they are
well actually i useta use eggs she does eat eggs i guess i
so i use them in cooking
a small one that she never really plays in
at her grandmother's house every time we go there she
for mummie
oh yeah
she likes to pick anything
if we go in the store she likes to pick leaves off bushes
patting for her is well if she's not sposta touch
i said not to touch the tape because we don't wanna take it off
pat it
or something
she said
pat
and she kissed it
and then pat it
so that's another constellation of of behavior that she
and children were beginning to hit her
the learning not to hit to be nice and that involves kissing
no she usually makes a tower
i think she was she was clapping for herself when she made a
like that she she felt that she was successful at that
the lining on the floor is just something that i did and i
but i was having a hard time trying to think what we could do with
i think she do i think she does
because i'm since i've been working i worked yesterday
and i often ask her what she's done the day before
and she can tell me you know pretty truthfully and
but it's not sophisticated
it's just it's usually common activities but she's told me
the walking thing was just in general
what does she do
when she walks she holds hands
with the other babies in her play group
www
lately she's been drawing on things
everything
including jackets coats walls floors couches and
yeah well i let her play by herself like today she
but sometimes it's more of an interaction like when she
yeah
she does
yeah
with a bigger ball it's easier for her to play you
let's see
mommy wants to put diapers on you
i think she does label things
i think yeah that she is learning a_lot_of new words
a zoo she just went to the zoo yesterday
right
she said tiger owl goose
no she really did see a goose
goose
and she's been
and she has seen all these the neat thing about it is she
yeah so_that it sort of made it more realistic for her
box
no
i noticed that myself
i think i thought at the time that i called it a box
so it's probably some ambivalence on my part about her
boxes
i think all kids when they see a box
oh no
i think all kids do when they see
oh you want that to be opened
you know box when they get gifts they enjoy the wrappings
yeah yeah we do
yeah
we did when she was a lot younger when i first realized that
the sort of use of the face to learn
parts of the body
yeah she's pretty good
well she knows chin and ears and tummy
things like that
and she doesn't say arms or legs yet
puppy
got a puppy
just yeah she does have a routine
that's funny like you don't i think i'm not really aware
she goes to the phone and she'll
she'll lift up the the receiver and she'll say
byebye
byebye or hi hi
and she talked to her meme and pepe her grandparents on the
and she is going to see them tonight
so i sort of prepare her for that
we're gonna go for the weekend
this oh the books
i think she just didn't wanna read books right now
she's more because books is kind of like a sitting down
the blocks
no
but she does play with blocks at home
quite a bit
yeah not mutilate it no
yeah
yes she does but i think more mine
yes she is
she's never done a zipper before
this is the first time she's ever done a zipper
ever
that i've ever seen her
yeah she was good for the zipper
but because she nurses i unbutton my blouse
button button
and play with the my clothes
more than i've seen her play with her own although she probably
yeah that's right
no i don't think she paid attention to that
yeah she does
i thought like i thought it was interesting that you know
maybe she's not ready for that concept
where're ya going baba
walk
a walk a walk
marie we hafta put your diapers on before we go home
look
what's under there
what's that
huh
that's you
yeah next time maybe we can come maybe i'll come in the
because after you'd left and we had arranged for this
when she's getting dressed no
no
not getting dressed because i don't talk to her that much
and she's not that talkative when she eats those kind of
she gets crazy
and she just sort of for about an hour she talks a lot
yeah she is
yeah she's i guess into doors
now
she learned how to open the door to our apartment and go out so i
but she always wants to go out
i don't know
i guess i said
night night
and she can identify with that
feeding it dinner and it's things that she does herself i
she thinks it's fun to do it with something else
like some kids do it with dolls but she doesn't play with
she has lots_of dolls half a dozen dolls
nothing nothing she just you know she just smile at
i think it's the fact that i was making the dragon move
and it was
no i hadta be there to do it
that's the main thing
yeah
yeah
no but she enjoys it when i play with them with her
it's i think it's a function of me doing it
we have cats
yeah but she sees dogs they're around
yes
she feeds she feeds she loves to feed the cats
she wants to feed them everytime she sees them
you know it's a big event
i'll put food in the dish and she'll carry the dish and
so
no
she loves puzzles and i read a_lot_of books to her
as much as you can read at that age
i have one called
good night moon
that she likes
because she's really intrigued with the moon
why don't you play over here
see all the fun toys
ya wanna sit in here again
okay
let me think she has a little record player
and i bought her a little cup and saucer set and
that kind of thing she likes outdoor things
riding her little tricycle and in fact that's all she wants to
the first thing in the morning
outside outside
but she will if shut in her room play with toys otherwise
or she follows me around and helps me do chores around the house
like well she'll unload the dishwasher for me you know
like i don't know she seems she seems like she loses
and i'll buy her something that i'll think she'll be interested
i don't know
she likes real things
like she she likes to get into my pots and pans and
or something unique like clothespins she likes to help
by handing me the clothespins the doggie
yes she says house when she sees house
real houses
yeah she says house you know we'll be going along and
so she does know what a house is
she knows all of them i think so because she even said
yeah i think so
where's the tongue dale
see she said tongue
yes
yes
she likes taking things in and out
i don't know what she was doing but i have a potted plant and she
all this dirt under the rug
but little things like that she does like
yes
she calls some people by name
i think so because sometimes she'll answer with her name
once in a great while she'll read a book by herself
but it's very short and mostly she'll bring it to me if i'm
she'll try it depends if they're those thick pages i
unless it's just grabbing and that kind of thing she really can't
i think she was just kinda bored with it
she has that book
i got her that book
and when you get towards the end she sort a loses
yeah she's not into blocks very much any more
except to throw them
i don't know she has a_lot_of blocks at home but she
she likes to throw them if anything
so i don't know why not
well maybe because the cats get fed maybe she's
i guess it is from observing
i don't really know
never thought about that
she never has been
when i come here
she has toy phones but she doesn't play with those either
but she does talk on the real phone now and then like her
i guess it depends on her mood
that could be
she was all by herself just in her room talking up a storm
of gobbledygook talk you know not
if you can call it that
well i want her to have a good pronunciation but i figure
i don't care if she doesn't perform perfectly at two years old
i think it's neat that she's talking and saying things and
she's pretty vocal on her own i just figure i'd rather
just anything she wants to say and worry about the
you mean like adults that come and say that to her
i guess because i have heard people come up and say
what's your name
and so i'm teaching her to answer with her name and probably
she's very talkative to people she'll always say hi and bye_bye
she's already talkative
so i guess maybe just to say her name but seems like she
i don't think so
she has one at home right like it
just like it
not really
i think the novelty's worn off
she immediately runs to where it is
and gets all excited
loves to pull on the cord if i don't keep it out_of reach
and when she listens to voices smiles
but won't say a word
i don't know
she'll come well she'll run to it immediately when it rings
no not at all she has a little rocking chair like
i don't think so
she didn't really respond when i yeah
i think all of them
she says up all the time
when she wants up
not as much as up
that's her favorite word i think she understands almost all
i don't think i've used upside down before
oh yeah
yeah
she'll put things like her dirty clothes in her clothes
she can follow a_lot_of directions put it in there out there
i shouldn't have done that
i won't get her a dragon
she stacks them
and oh she loves to throw them that's the latest thing
smaller ones though that she throws
depends on her mood
sometimes she is but not today
no
yeah for at home she will
yeah
she has a little book with nursery rhymes that she really
and she i don't know she sort a seems like
read i mean you know look at the pictures
she has about eight or ten books
that's it
probably not
no not at all
i don't maybe i do i don't know
i did that i must i did in the book
and maybe i do i didn't think that i do
yes
well mostly little boys actually
there's one little girl but she's a bit older
there's not many little girls around where she is
i've seen her doing it she likes to touch them i just
that's the first time i ever said i didn't even know she knew
we look in the mirror together i don't know if i say
who's that
maybe i do
i don't know
i i'm not sure
she knows yeah in fact i don't know if you saw it
she she wasn't interested in the doll's shoes maybe because
she has sneakers and sandals she brings them to me i say go
yeah she unties them i hafta double knot them
all the time
yeah she'll use a brush on her own hair and in fact if
it's one of her favorite things
some well she has some things i call cups and others that
i think she knows cup but she just wasn't that interested
but it broke apart and i never got her a new one but whenever
so that's they way xxx
i think so when it's lunchtime i'll say let's go
let's are you ready for lunch
she'll just drop what she's doing and run into the kitchen and
i use eat yes i do i don't think meat comes up very
i don't think that means anything to her
she knows no i'll say i'll say
ya want some more chicken
or hot dog or sandwich food might be to entice her
yeah she says it too
when she wants more yeah if she's eating
books
she's got several books not like this
this is one of the cutest books i've ever seen it's a an
it's cute
she's got one of these she likes to put things
i don't i really don't know if she's that familiar
there is a dog where she sometimes goes to the
one of them's kitty and the other one has another name
no we just started calling it that and
yeah very small ones
she stacks them
throws them
carries em around as many as she can at once
i thought she might know kitty but that's about the only
i don't think so
she might know boy

she brings them to me and makes me go through them over and
and you know sometimes she sits
like that by herself
she looks at them
she's got a raggedy ann and a another soft no
yeah just sit around

yeah i know what you mean i
it just never occurred to me to think of you know it's a
she has a puppet
sometimes she likes it

very loving to it and other times she could care less about
no and that was a new routine i'd never done that with her
yeah she feeds herself
yeah combs and brushes she'll brush
oh did i
i just called it a bunny because it said bunny on it so
i think i've always used the word bunny no rabbit
yeah it seems like an easy thing to memorize you know one
yeah she has a number book at home
seven bunnies
yeah she lifts it up and goes that allo allo
and whenever the phone rings if like sometimes her father
she never says a word but a big smile comes on her face
she's got two toy ones
one of them's just like this a different color and the
i really don't know
she useta wrap this one around her neck and walk around the house
so but she does do that
hello hello
so you know so as though she had some connection
she runs to the phone
it's a big event
it's not when she's done playing
it can happen any time
with any number of things she likes to put things in
she likes to seems to like to put things in a an orderly
not every time once in a while i tell her but she
i think she knows put

she can say yellow
lalasc and lollyc is yellow
red she can say but she says a weird word

she can throw them they're great
she can stack them and knock them over and they don't hurt anything

and she's starting stacking those up the little things around
and every time i walk into a room i see xxx another

she feeds the dog all the time
from her chair when she's eating

she's talked to him on the phone actually when he's in new york

she just listens and she knew it was him
and she would say
daddy daddy
afterwards and point at the phone and
daddy's doing tape recordings now too and she we've got him on
daddy daddy
so_that she makes all these good connections

you know he has more on his key chain
but she makes some up where they go but she's got a bit
oh
she's getting older
no i the cats are growing up the kitten that grandma had

pancake
i don't think she thought it was a cake
it started with an hl in the book
there's another different word for the same thing
no i try not to show her those things
we try not to
lollipops are about the only thing she's gotten into and maybe
but no i try to steer clear of those aisles
yeah that's true yeah
yes they are she has her toys she has her books and she
i probably said that about some certain things around that she
but it is not a toy
no
she was interested on on the mass pike this morning
about the buses and trucks going by but not the trucks
we don't have any trucks
i don't have the little cars she's played with but
yes she does
one that's one month younger than her and we're in a play
oh yeah he's got boy's toys
yes yes
one or whatever she'll count to see if it's one two she's
i think it has a lot to do with sesame street and ernie and
they have the counting
the froggie too
a baseball
she thought it had a baseball in his hand richard plays with
she's never worn one and she's always had so much hair i
she never had a cap
she's been into colors a lot a long time she walks around
i can't imagine what it will be like pumpkins
www
we have a rocking chair and a regular chair at home with
from the garden
the garden's been great
not really because basically all that's zinnias or marigolds
i'm not sure i tell her what they are the roses only came out
i'll pick this flower
well she useta wear one they're around they're still in the
and she's pretty neat now with eating so it's not that
yes
very familiar
i don't drink it
no we don't have it around
she's useta tea you know not coffee
oh yes
it's in the car right now
do ya wanna sit down on that chair
you can sit down on that chair if you like
she doesn't eat out_of glass bowls the big bowls like that
she's not sure what a knife is but i don't let her have one so
zips the bag
her bag
she zips that up and down she unties real well
she's just beginning to put shoes on her self like her tennis shoes
and buckling
it's mostly like this
just pullover very let's see the blue jeans now have
the pants
she hasn't really tried
yeah
she's doesn't really care you know one way or the other
she doesn't make any it not really
she doesn't like to take anything off
she's just happy with what she's wearing
my little nudist
she can zip things up but not down
that's because when you zip down when you zip these pants down
well she's not really sure that's what she should do first
think what i've noticed with the bag she's she's been really
but not zipping it back up
no and we have some beautiful wooden blocks too that she just
whereas the little boy richard came over to the house and he
and she just has no desire to build
just from reading the books
she started doing that
i xxx with the drawing like just draw the cl and the cl is
no she ended up finding out bl for boo_boo herself the dog's
but she picked up the bl for boo_boo herself and cl for cindy
it's a weird letter
and cookie starts with cl
yeah he's your friend
she tries
she has the brush usually the opposite way
she has the hard part down on her head and the bristles
but she tries
and sometimes she gets the hair
for her to do it to someone else
i don't know she's
yeah she can get the brush the right way but it's hard for her
but she's tried dogs and dolls well the dog has such
and gus is so soft it's not like he has anything to comb either
yes
she she had a pretend tea party and she fed all of her little
she was making all the little out_of
oh we had gotten some clay recently she's been playing with
she'll say it and it'll be sort of a little weird however i
then when she can say it again she usually cleans it up a little
sometimes sometimes she doesn't
depends on what time she feels
but she often will
she knows all her colors
yes
just just like we did before but now instead of having to
it's great
seems to come through
pink
and green were the very first colors and orange seemed to come
red was the hardest
but red she can say now
i think she just had difficulty saying it
and white didn't seem to be that hard to understand and black
nothing is black when you ask for colors usually
she zips bags up and down she has her little bags
just a sec i'll give it to ya
there ya go grapes
now you can go play with the books okay
go look through those books
they're new
we haven't seen those books before
we have a ton of books at home and she can tell me exactly
hand hand
that's her favorite
no no none of these
yeah that book especially
we have a doctor seuss's abc book and they they ya just
this it does it's a little over the heads i think
well words like vanilla ice cream i'm i'm not sure
i thought that was a good word because it's not in our book
our book has something like jelly jars and jam and she's
except she knows what jelly is
but
yeah and she's pretty good about yelling for it
bib
bib
gimme that bib
i try to not have her wear it lately because she's been eating
yeah she does she has a little blue cup
and ya drink you juice out_of it too
she feeds the dog all the time
everything she's not sposta
her meal
she'll feed the dog she'll pick out all the good stuff
here scoob have some good stuff
she plays with mirrors all the time
just i always did when i was a little kid
and i remember my own fascination from it
so when she was in a playpen i've always given her unbreakable
and she's gotten into looking at lights or looking at the
oh yeah well first of all when you look in a mirror
there's cindy
or
look at cindy
so she could see how dirty her face was or wasn't so i could wash
and she would be more pleased if it were dirty to let me wash
so that's worked out very well
we have strawberries in our garden
she's very aware of those because they're growing the
go stack your blocks
pick all the blocks up
well shoes yes
she tries to put them on and she tries to put her clothes on
but she helps me when when i'm undressing her like
she's always very good when you dress her
left leg
yeah well her daddy's talked to her
he's been back and forth in new_york with his band so he calls
and she talks to him it's really cute
she'll tell him what she's done in two or three words like if
she went to the ocean she told him ocean
it so funny
what'd you see at the ocean
i mean at the aquarium
fish
did you see shark
big shark
really neat
yeah she did appreciate them as fish
she knew they were fish and we saw the movie which was
and that kinda gives you an even better perspective because
and the sharks were there
since they redid it i hadn't been there for a long time you can
you saw the sharks didn't ya
she remembered when it snowed and she had a snowman book i
we'd always go out and make a point of it when it did
no she's just those are things that she's had experience
she doesn't really play with my keys very much
she knows what they are i don't think she really cares that
balls yes
balls are great
i have yarn but it's in balls so that's why i said
balls of yarn
when i talk to her about it
she always points to it she knows kittens play with it she knows
she loves eggs
don't cha
loves ducks
favorite animals dog
yeah
well because that really got her she was the most
not like this
she has got
actually i was gonna ask you where you got them she
but these are more fun to knock down
yeah on the changing table i do put a diaper over her face and
i have never done it with blocks before
i have never really been right in front of her and had blocks
usually you know if we are in this situation we are
yeah like combing the dog and stuff
yeah
we have got a dog with a brush and yeah
and she combs her own hair
loren has a couple of brushes and yeah
she has she has combed our dog before
oh i mean watched me and then you know had it in her hand but
oh yeah
she has got a telephone
yeah and ours has a dial and i make it ring and she picks it
hello
and we usually pretend it is daddy
we call him
yeah you want this
no that picture no no she might relate better to baby
a_lot_of times i call things baby or we have a
we call him baby bunny mommy bunny sometimes too but i
no and i do not think these would probably be
but since these were side by side did not hurt to
what are you doing
she likes to put things the putting in and taking out we
she likes to put them away
her books right now
i do not know why she did not really respond to
or just the plain blocks like that but it's characters doing
she is really into books
she will bring books wherever you are in the house
she will go into her room and bring books out and she backs up to
i realize that the whole first half i was really directing
i think that is that happens a lot at home too
i did not think she was saying very much but
so far yeah
yeah it was ants i think the second time
an ant
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
because we've seen butterflies out in the yard we call that
well she was saying duck and then she started consistently
i didn't care
no because not now not at this point
i think a little bit later on i mean if if it had
i don't think she knows the difference
well she was saying boy she said boy at one point in this
hm
she doesn't respond
oh well i never even thought of naming that
she knows that so well but we started with well the face
oh the tongue and the teeth and the mouth and the nose and
alice where's your tongue
where's stick it out
stick it right out
go
and socks
they're all shoes
they're all shoes to her
she knows socks
and then you sort of pointed out the other things that went with
things like drinking out_of the cup
she doesn't use a bib so she doesn't know that word at all
and we don't say cup she doesn't use a cup she uses either a
cereal and soup yeah
we kiss a lot
and we ask her for kisses a lot and she kisses her sister a
at one point
but so the smelling the book let's see we had a couple a
well the puppy bites her
i tell her to tell me whenever the puppy bites and then we whack
oh yeah we got some cloth covered blocks like this that we
yes yeah
she always recognizes an apple
well she climbs on everybody else's
no she doesn't
well yeah she has some
she has a set of chairs but it's really lauren lauren's set
yeah i was surprised
about a week and a half ago she started saying chair and i
yeah
and i don't know where that came from
well occasionally
about a couple of weeks ago she had my keys where's groucho
she can say groucho and chico
we've got these two cats that live in our house and she says
well a lit occasionally she does she'll reach for
that's when i noticed that she could say it
and so i give them to her if she can say it
she can have it
well she she says that a lot
yeah
she useta say ball
well she calls balloons balls
and when she saw that she said ball right away
but she said it very clearly the way she useta say it
she has mommy see and of course all_gone but that's not
daddy bye is daddy gone
or sister
and she says something else that i thought is a really long
it has about three words in it
she doesn't under stand that concept
to three at least she only skips five so number
she started the routine because i haven't been doing any
i think she really start counting because in the gym we she
they all do that
i don't think so
i don't think so
they just have that one routine
well on my lap i guess because we have a baby next store so
because she speaks in a high voice to a baby
and she speaks i mean i don't remember speaking in a high
and she goes through that whole routine with the baby
and we we were really amused
i think the word lapq because the baby always sits on the mother's
i don't know
see i don't i don't think that we teach her anything
but you know except by what we say
no no
on his knees yeah
yeah instead of humpty dumpty
yeah she really does know
yes by hair
not by any sex parts although she knows there's a big difference
she uses me to do things for her usually
it's usually mommyq do it and i hafta urge her to do it so i
she still used me
smaller ones
just started to play with blocks
she's not that
i initiated the bridge concept and she still doesn't do that
but won't make a bridge herself
she'll make a tower she knows what a bridge is like
so she knows the concept of a bridge but she's not i don't
no i'm not done yet
no
i don't like that toy
we have we just have baby dolls
yes
and michael's
she wants to zip and unzip my pants and my belt
she doesn't have a lot you know she doesn't have belts
yeah she's trying to do shoes now
but she can't do them yet
she doesn't try to untie
yeah
easily
now has become a big word
she gets on the phone and says
daddy come home now
yeah well we're trying to share now because she has
she's entered that stage when everything is
mine
yeah
yes
but she would never say it's mike's turn
yeah well she likes to play with me
yeah
yeah a_lot_of
like me
like annie does
like she wants to be like someone else is
if someone's bigger
so like
mommy does
again again again again
she likes to really repeat like songs i mean we'll
right
a very small baby like she'll help peter my nephew's
but no one her own size she's really not sharing very
i don't think
yes
yes and turns everything on and it's getting difficult
well we try
yes
she'll put one thing back
she likes things in their place
if its something like a coat she always insists that i hang it up
but when it's all her toys all over the floor she's not the
well because lots_of times i'll tell her that something
for instance we've been putting in a garden
i'll tell her that the wheelbarrow is too heavy for her
but she insists on trying it anyway
proving to herself that she can't carry groceries in the house
you know i i almost mentioned it to her this morning and
so i was surprised
i don't know what she thinks some of them are
i i mean most of them are neuter
except the obvious little girl dolls
well the humpty dumpty's i think she considers as boys
what's the date today
she'll be twenty months tomorrow
that big sound after the elephant is my husband makes a huge sound
i was afraid to hold her off because we're going away on friday
it's always hello the person's name and then oftentimes she
i mean she gets a response
no on the fake
or on the real one when there's no one on the other end
call
yeah her father and then mark and christopher who
always
the dragon
oh
she puts everything up in do you mean in human
everything goes every place
oh yes
always
she usually reads to the toys
the toys don't usually take can't usually do anything that's
can you put everything into the box for us
no the steam coming out_of the the steam coming out_of the
the kite tail
she knows about steam because we she oftentimes will in
but i'm not sure she's ever seen steam in a book
because lots_of times things are too hot and the stock phrase
i'm going to separate this with my spoon to let the steam out
is the phrase
so she knows what steam is
we've seen all of them
but she doesn't use the words for them
she only knows fire engine and truck
the dump truck she knows
she's not especially interested
yeah a_lot_of kids do but she doesn't seem to be very
cow's on the next page
i don't know
i'm surprised she doesn't know snowman but i guess she doesn't
i know for a fact that when my brother inlaw babysat for her
so i was a little surprised she didn't know what that was
i think sometimes she has trouble it useta be she knew
now it seems like if she's seen it in real life she has a
i don't think she's ever seen a snowman a real snowman i
she's back into sitting on laps
she's kind of regressing i don't know what you call it
she i think she's going through a stage although i don't
i don't know anything about stages in children yet
but she's getting quite difficult to separate from me
the lunch box her nephew got a lunch box
and we keep telling her that when she goes to school she can have
she's quite she loved that lunch box
she's been a couple of times to try her out
yeah she understands them
talked about them before i was hoping that she would talk about
also i wanted her to get useta the fact that she's not going to
because she really is attached to this marco beyond belief
yeah a cousin who abuses her terribly
she understands going on a boat i think she understands fishing
well she's had someone else's fishing pole they play on the
play in the waves you know
make castles in the sand all the things that children do
not a lot
she builds with blocks but
not creatively
mostly it's
she doesn't make bridges she stacks
she's not counting much these days
although she was the last time she was here i remember she
no i don't think she asks how many usually
oh she'll pretend sometimes to be counting if there's a bunch
and she'll always go by rote one two three four five six
but i don't think she's connecting them
yeah she's
slide it through the hole
usually
but i was showing her as_well
she wanted to well she wanted to undress him and she zipped
yes
they have some names
some of them have names
one is dolly
that's the dolls' name dolly i figured and one is
because it's raggedy ann
she had a thumb operation
she wanted to know if he was going to fix peter's thumb
now she thinks that everyone who goes to the doctor she had an
now she thinks that everyone who's going to the doctor is going to
she must think people have strange thumbs
yeah she wasn't
i'm surprised
i i think she's not paying much attention today
but i'm not going to make excuses sometimes she does and
she's not super she doesn't sit and listen to books as much
you mean my asking
what is that
sure
she went to the dentist a couple of weeks ago with us and you
it's kind of like a symbiotic relationship
we have a book called crocodile tears which she's always enjoyed
it didn't crack her up
but it cracked me up because it looked like looked like you
of course the turtle doesn't have any teeth
she calls all fat we have several hupty dumpty's and she
i noticed i noticed there's an several other play areas
i don't know why
it's a familiar familiar character i guess
yeah she knows buttons and snaps
she can't do them
she can't do them but she knows when we do them
she can't motor do them
i think so
snaps is odd except that all baby tshirts have
no they're not
they're twohanded
i mean you hafta hold one and pull with the other
who are you calling really
you never call mommy
who are ya calling
hello
we don't have this kind of telephone yeah they're all dials
that's a nice one isn't it
hello
hello
ding ding ding stop playing with the phone
put the phone back
hello
this makes a sound
yeah usually we call daddy
is daddy there
but she uses the real phone she'll talk to him on the phone
byebye
can ya put it back
no
my sister my sister lives in the same house with us
daddy home
no he went to work
yeah and puppydogs no difference same word
i was noticing in fact thinking about this yesterday quite a
so she seems to make a distinction on the size
but not with dogs
yeah
originally
except that we have a book that has a dragon in it
so she knows a dragon
you know that's why i was a little surprised frankly
i frankly was surprised that she didn't know that that was a dragon
this is a nice toy i've never seen this one before
she hasn't been to a zoo yet so she doesn't understand what those
she's tried puppets at home she's a little afraid of it though
but she knows she knows what puppets we have
she's also watching the muppets on television my husband
i hope
yeah i hope she does
because stereos and televisions oh aren't toys
so she doesn't play with them although she does play with them
this is nan's this is nan's it's not annie's and it's not a
right
yeah a_lot_of things are horses words animals that she's
no but we have a yeah she's seen lots_of pictures of cows
let's get down alright
let's get down
you didn't even see this bunny
what's that
mousie it's not a mousie it's a bunny
i'm reminded of a handicapped cp girl that i worked with for
and she said the words that were appropriate to her
and i think that's what happens with a kid
that's why the mother can can interpret what she's
my husband hates cats and every time he sees one he goes
rat
it's obviously working but i think it's getting her a bit
obviously the books make her talk less
yeah yeah we have lots_of books she doesn't use books at
it's usually at a quieter you know when i'm trying to get
but it's hard for someone her age to sit anyway
she's gonna be two october fifth so twenty two months
no
but
they're named

well it's not conscious
it's saying
maura get the bowls for the cereal
we need the spoon
where's your napkin
does anybody need more juice
no
last night she did the most extraordinary thing
she found a comb and she was combing my hair and
which i thought was extraordinary
didn't name
no i was surprised
no she knows comb
i would say she knows comb better than brush
because that's what she used on the kid's hair
she wouldn't say it
no
you are dressed
i'll fix it
yeah
how are you i am fine
yeah that's what she was i think
no when she gets on a real live phone she doesn't say a word
that's grammy
but
yes talks and uses words grammatically
give it to me here this is yours
i mean it's all very grammatical
no she'll ask
she'll say
help me
well under the circumstances i was right here
but if she was trying to do something she would come and get me
help me
open the door
i wanna go outside
the dolly is stuck
whatever and she'll tell me as much as she can
no she can
most of her dresses have buttons in back
so she can't get those off
her nightgowns that have buttons in front i hafta to pin
because she'll take them off
in the middle of the night
her underpants she can't get off
they she does but she does it it's not that she's
or she'll go and she'll get clothes she'll put on my shoes and
no well maura does i've never watched i don't
because mommy's name is cassy
and if she's mommy she calls me cassy
isn't that interesting
car keys
well those are mommy's keys and that's where she sees them
normally she calls sneakers sneakers sandals sandals slippers
i i may
i don't realize it if i'm doing it
i mean i think what i probably do is say let's put on your
let's put on your sneakers
let's put on your sandals
let's put on your boots
just and i don't know what i do
not as much as i should
well i'm just aware of what i did for maura
and less for jeff and virtually nonexistent for this
i think so
she likes that one
she always laughs when she hears about the
dish ran away with the spoon
she thinks that she thinks that's funny
i doubt i doubt it
i don't know
yes because the last time we went to my mother's house we did
where's grammy's lake
she said as we approached as we pulled into the driveway
this is grammy's house
where's grammy's lake
because she had only seen the lake once
she won't let go of me
oh she went swimming at lindsey's house
yes she is extraordinarily good in the bathtub and the little
but once she's got the lifepreserver on in deep water she clings
yes
she washes her face clean
after she has she eats if she spills anything on her dress
she takes the washcloth and washes her hands and then she
we just got a new one
the old one was broken
i wouldn't say so but i may be wrong
no
oh that's just the telephone routine
she may not do it on the real telephone but she may do it on her
i mean if she's playing i'll say
call daddy and ask him what he wants for lunch
yes that i will do
when i see it but it doesn't happen every day
sometimes she will
sometimes she'll just listen
probably she doesn't expect it to happen so and because i
no but she sees maura's hair in the morning and she sees me do my
yes she's been taking my brush
and brushing her hair
brushing my hair
i have never seen her do it but she's taken very good care
put this away in the box
nobody that we know has pets but she may have seen
the doggie needs his hair combed
yeah go find his house
i don't think so
but she does pull the books out_of the bookcase and reads them to
no she looks at the she likes reading the telephone book
she picked up a bible one day and said
jesus
very interesting
sometimes she comes out with the right answer
i don't know whether it's a lucky guess or whether she really
what color's this
she'll say blue green red or yellow and a_lot_of times
probably not
she wasn't concentrating on it so i would say not
she wasn't paying i didn't think she was paying attention to
i think she was thinking
i don't think i would ask her what color this orange is i'd
lena is that blue
what color's mommy's dress
see i'm not sure she really knows but she knows colors and when
i know
she said
that's a girl
and i would have said it's a boy
but i noticed that the hair was curly maybe that's
she does it a lot faster sometimes than i do
she seems to be right i mean i'll look
is that a boy or a girl
and she'll say
that's a boy
and i'll look closely and say
right it is a boy
i would like to know what she i i'm looking at too
i can't think
we're going into winter and she has a jacket with a zipper
this sweater has a zipper in the back
so she's never i can't think of anything that she's owned
so i couldn't tell you or not up or down is easy
she had a pretty good grasp on it but didn't know how to
and the ice cream i put in the mugs they've had their milk in
no
she really knows
she really uses it correctly
she says
this is his this is jeff's this is mine this is
she knows
her dollies
the other things are things nobody else would want anyway
her slippers her nightgown her clothes her room
she's very good about sharing
the concept seems to be deep and she's willing
the thing that occurred to me is the whale had blue around it
i looked again and i thought
maybe you could think it was clouds
no she knew turtle she didn't know the mouse and i
like a mouse
oh yeah
i said did you wanna match it match it or something
i give up
noise is unbearable
she seems to know two in fact she's three because i can
maura has a doll house
but she's talked a lot about a big house
the big house
there's my house when we drive past it
that's my house
and she's been playing with the bigger lego blocks
no
i don't
no yeah well it's there is a difference in in
yeah i like to do that i don't i don't think she knows
she knows bird she knows a rooster she knows a cow a
she's never seen butterflies either she looks at them a
she she really likes books
she what she does mostly is look at them
and either you can ask her to show you what the different
probably more often is sit there and point to the picture
and have you tell her what it is
yeah most of the time
she usually she usually looks for what she wants
i use them both
a lot
sometimes i call them bunny rabbits you know i just do use
no
i don't think i every really thought about it
yeah i do i guess
i don't i never really thought about it much
i i talk to them a lot i think probably and i usually
on her self she knows she knows all the face parts she
yeah just playing but she does
she does zippers
she likes zippers
she's always been kinda fascinated with zippers she doesn't do
she doesn't do snaps or button or anything
up and down which way
oh i think she knows when she is somewhere if i say to her
do you wanna get down
that it means out_of where she is
down from where she is i guess she does know that
i think she does i don't really think she knows asleep as
and there's a cat in here that was asleep and
and she knows when yeah when your eyes are open it means
yeah different from these but she does have some
she stacks them some but mostly what she does is put them in
and knock them over
we'll i think dragons are a pretty distinct thing
you know i mean it's like saying it's a horse or a cow
that's what it was
well if it's a dragon it's a dragon you know
i think adults probably associate bad things with dragons but
yeah
yeah i point out a_lot_of things to her you know we're
i've even tried making a distinction between pigeons and other
yeah yeah she's probably not as specific well
yeah she does
yeah well she just she kinda picks it up and she
like she was talking to somebody on the phone
a_lot_of times she picks up the phone and then yells for me
yeah yeah she really likes playing peekaboo
she likes putting things over her face and disappearing
are you brushing my hair
are you brushing my hair
no
i i think they probably understand maybe the same amount
you know she kinda sits there like she's talking to you sometimes
doesn't really do that
she does once in a while but not like amelia does
no i've been reading to them a little bit but they don't pay
that's that's about all she does
she she does that and she points or she brings me somewhere
otherwise she doesn't i don't think have any
yeah the same way
well she knows baby and flower
and ducks
and birds
and she's easy to pick she can pick those out pretty easily
yes probably everything but the mouse and the owl
she tries to say boat
we have a boat
so she's familiar with that
she she does say dog i guess
yeah she does say dog
we have a dog also so
no
my mother's trying to get rid of some cats
i don't know
well i thought maybe she was she was saying
another one
because i was saying that to her
you know and i think that's something i probably say to her a lot
and she was doing that pointing to the same thing
i think she has another expression for what's that that sounds
what's that
yeah she's always asking what things are
you know in new books or anything she always wants she
well they don't have any books with paper pages and they like
and things they like to rip up things with paper pages
she can take her clothes off
you know she can't put her anything on
but she she she does try to put things on
yeah
they have new sneakers
yeah she unties her shoes and takes them off
no she usually doesn't want them back on again
what do you want
this
yeah she's been saying flower for a long time
what do you want this
it's not a baby it's a boy
looks like a baby to you i guess
another baby
no
no she doesn't
yeah i usually point out
words numbers that's probably why she was pointing them out
no she doesn't
i think that she knows that they're different than pictures
no
but this book rips apart
i don't know
i can't think of anything really
she talks to but never sounds like she's saying anything to
they kind of babble back and forth to each_other
i don't know
maybe six seven words one two probably has two
yeah says grover and
oh yeah she does
well she knows real houses she doesn't really have
well well kristin does kristin has a doll house that she
oh i don't know it
she says she says a_lot_of things like that that sound like
you know like she says something like
i wanna walk
and the only thing you can really understand is the walk part
no
well there was nobody talking to her
she doesn't have a toy phone anymore
she useta but she doesn't any more
and she's only had contact with a real phone recently
she listens she doesn't talk much she listens more
that's the dog's
well it didn't do anything i guess for her
no
she just she brushes her own hair but she doesn't she
the nose it looked just like the eyes
we have a dog
so i think that's probably why
ya wanna go in there
yes
she hangs onto the dog's tail and lets the dog pull her around the
no
i think she was afraid of it because it moved
yeah then it was okay
no
they have had a puppet i can't i can't remember
recently they go outside a lot they play with
you know they like things that do things
yeah that's mostly what she's got at home
although she now likes to look at magazines she likes to
and kids
i did it the first time i could get it out though
the books she has are very simple
probably because i prefer those kind of books
not you look at books that have a cluttering of things on the
hum
yeah
no
no she's usually very good about it i don't know maybe
she picks out cats very well
no
she calls them kids
a_lot_of times
do you want this in
i just had it in and there you wanted it out
she calls the dog her name
yes she does
no just her highchair
you don't want this
alright why don't you go put it away
can you go do that for me
no
yeah
she does
she scribbles with them
yeah she was saying writeq that was what she was saying
no i think she understands
yeah she knows
i think she understands those
just pull it out it'll come out
she likes holes
oh yeah she likes to stack them she likes to knock them
no
hum

those important things
only the blocks and the doll and the stuffed dog
well books
she has a_lot_of books
and she can say book too
she can't say telephone
but she says hi
she doesn't zip and unzip
we don't practice that
i mean is that dapper dan
we don't have that and she's not encouraged to tie and untie

right
well i double knot them but i i don't know
i just we don't play with her shoes
oh pretty aware we have some animal books
mostly dogs and cats but getting to chicks and ducks and pigs
i have no idea what a camel says but we decided that a camel says
and whenever i say there's a camel she starts to smile cause she
so we have those animals and yeah and a turtle and
yeah and we call squirrels kitty but just because she sees them
yeah yeah we have of course lauren has a
she likes to comb her own hair and she will comb some animals that
well we have a hamster
actually i'm after a puppy right now

probably less
she was in a stage then and we got her a phone and she played
but she did like the pushbutton phone
okay alice
we don't have a pushbutton phone at home
at home i
mostly i just point and say what's that
i guess i'm thinking about it now
i don't really say can you say
i don't really say that i guess as often as i said it here
i was really aware that she wasn't saying anything
but that's why
she really did say more than she did last time
i can't tell you how much more verbal she is at home
she's doing things like this
she's exploring the whole house
it's she's never confined
it's impossible
i don't usually ask her what she wants she usually shows
but that was a situation of her being up here and it being on the
but if i say what do you want she'll go get it
but
she might if it was a doggie
because i really thought she wanted the doggie
yeah doggie she could say
and i think that was what i was trying to get her to to say
but i thought maybe she would say it if she couldn't reach it
but she's much she's really more physical than
all this throwing and everything
yeah she really is
i mean she would much more i mean she would much rather
you know what now i mean or books she'll look
she has a similar one with things to touch and look
she did
she put her finger through the hole yeah
